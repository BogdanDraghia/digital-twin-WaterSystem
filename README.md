# Project - Digital Twin WaterSystem

## Goals

Create a comprehensive digital twin system for hospital water infrastructure using Three.js to visualize and monitor water systems in real-time. The system ensures all water systems are represented as digital twins with active water flow simulation to prevent microbial growth and maintain hygiene standards. Additionally, the platform enables monitoring of water usage patterns, inspection logs, and provides automated maintenance alerts to optimize system reliability and safety.
